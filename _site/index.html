        <p>
          Welcome to a Grand Array of Resources For Junior Associate Loathing
          Engineer Newbies. Also known as GARFJALEN, to true degenerates.
        </p>

        <h2 id="for-those-new-to-scripting">For those new to scripting</h2>

        <p>
          This is meant to be a source where folks who do not know how to code
          can go to learn the ropes. If you are new to scripting the Kingdom of
          Loathing (KOL), and would like to learn, start at our
          <a
            href="https://loathing-associates-scripting-society.github.io/KoL-Scripting-Resources/CS-Scripting-Resources.html"
            >basic first-step introduction to KoL scripting.</a
          >
        </p>

        <h2 id="for-those-who-want-to-help">For those who want to help</h2>

        <p>
          If you’d like to help with GARFJALEN, that’s fantastic! We are always
          looking to create a more robust set of resources for KOL scripting
          folks, both new and old. This repository accepts pull requests. Our
          general rule is that we prefer branches, but in terms of adding new
          content, the process is easy:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a branch named for your new page</li>
          <li>
            Make a new .md file in the root directory representing your page
          </li>
          <li>
            Populate it with content. If you want to use images, please store
            them in the assets/img/ folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EXTRA CREDIT:</strong> To update the navbar with your new
            page, update the _config.yml file; there’s a walkthrough in the
            comments.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once your branch is ready to go, submit a
          <strong>pull request</strong> and a LASS developer will examine and
          approve your request when we’re free. If you would like to talk to the
          developers working on this resource directly, please join the
          <a href="https://discord.com/invite/k3vR3caDkF"
            >Ascension Speed Society Discord</a
          >
          and reach out in the #mafia-and-scripting channel. We’d love to hear
          from you!
        </p>

        <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
        <p>
          Huge thanks to any and all developers who have added to the massive
          corpus of useful KoL scripting content over the years. It would be
          impossible for us to cover everyone who deserves credit, but we would
          be remiss not to mention a few core individuals:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Holatuwol &amp; Veracity, the two leading developers of KoLMafia,
            and all Mafia devs through the years
          </li>
          <li>
            The developers of LASS, who are consistently keeping vital scripts
            alive and powering the game’s speedrunning tools
          </li>
          <li>
            The beautiful and handsome horrible-little-slime, an incredible
            GitHub
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Make your first pull request today.</p>
